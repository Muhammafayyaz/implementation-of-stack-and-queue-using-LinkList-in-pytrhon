# Implementation of Stack and Queue using Linked List

1- **Clone the Repository**:

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Clone the repository using the following command:

git clone  https://github.com/Muhammafayyaz/implementation-of-stack-and-queue-using-LinkList-in-pytrhon

cd implementation of stack and queue using Linklist

2- **Run the Stack Implementation**:

Navigate to the directory where the stack implementation file `implementation Stack using (LinkList).py` is located.

Run the stack program using Python:
python Stack_using_LinkList.py

3- **Run the Queue Implementation**:

Navigate to the directory where the queue implementation file `implement queue using(Linklist).py` is located.

Run the queue program using Python:

## Purpose of the Code

This project highlights the effectiveness of linked lists in building dynamic and efficient data structures. By utilizing stacks and queues, we can execute common operations with optimal performance, making it a vital resource for any developer's toolkit.

## Features -
**Stack Implementation**:
- push():     Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- pop():      Removes the top element from the stack.
- peek():     Views the top element without removing it.
- is_empty(): Checks if the stack is empty.
- display():  Shows the elements in the stack.

**Queue Implementation**:
- enqueue():   Adds an element to the end of the queue.
- dequeue():   Removes the front element from the queue.
- peek():      Views the front element without removing it.
- is_empty():  Checks if the queue is empty.
- display():   Shows the elements in the queue

## Time Complexity for Stack and Queue
- push(): O(1)
- pop(): O(1)
- peek(): O(1)
- is_empty(): O(1)
- display(): O(n)

- 
enqueue(): O(1)
dequeue(): O(1)
peek(): O(1)
is_empty(): O(1)
display(): O(n)
